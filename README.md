# VRTourCreator

Build your own virtual tour by adding your 360-degree images to this application and create your desired pathway for navigation between images. This version of the application is working with Oculus Go. 

I used "360 VR Player" asset to have an animation when the user is transferring between images.


I am proud of managing the pathway by creating a custom tree structure. This is handled mainly in three files including Target.cs, Loadimages.cs, and ChangeRoom.cs. Furthermore, I am ashamed of using PlayerPrefs to Store data (Class: LoadImages, Start function).
